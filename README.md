## About
This project actually started as a hobby project, but within my studies for my bachelor I attended a course where I had the opportunity to finish this project for my grade.

## Structure
At the time I wrote this README the project already was more than two years old. So some decisions like the usa of Coffeescript would not make any sense today.
It was not a bad choice but with ES6 now almost supported by all browsers, it would mark a better solution for today.
This project was written In CoffeeScript, [pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) (previously Jade), [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/), Express4 and MongoDB.
